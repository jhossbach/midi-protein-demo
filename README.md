## Simulation script for polymer stretching using the MIDI controller

### Prerequisites
 - All packages in requirements.txt installed
 - Espresso (tested on version 4.2)
 - MIDI controller recognized (Linux: check output of `lsusb` for something like `iCON iCON iControls_Pro(M) V1.04`

If the MIDI controller is not found, try to unplug the controller from both the power supply and the usb plug and plugging it back in (sometimes the order is also important for some reason)
